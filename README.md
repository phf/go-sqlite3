# SQLite database driver for Go

The SQLite driver supports the generic database API
described here:

[http://github.com/phf/go-db](http://github.com/phf/go-db)

The driver is not yet stable! If you decide to track
it, you should be okay with frequent, potentially
incompatible changes. You have been warned.

To install, clone into $GOROOT/src/pkg/db/sqlite3/
for now.
